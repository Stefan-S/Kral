## The story starts like this...
I was a student at the faculty for Natural Sciences and Mathematics, at the Institute of Informatics. (now transferred to FINKI). I have just finished the first year at the faculty and I really have learned a lot. I was already feeling that i know a lot of how can I make an arbitrary software and even if I didn't knew something I knew how to find what I needed.

Since I was keen on games, i started thinking on how to make an intelligent opponent in a game. Knowing that the Chess problem was already famous and a PC has already beaten the best contemporary world chess champion, I knew that it was a good direction.

Without first even reading on how an AI is done, I gave a serious thought on how can my PC know which action is the best for it. I really believed that it would be a wonderful chess player, and started implementing it. I spend couple of mounts on writing approximately 10k lines of code by hand, just to prove myself that I was wrong. My algorithm was based on choosing the actions that had the biggest impact on the total value of the chess pieces and expanding only those actions to verify the profitability. I have never been so wrong.

That is why I end up modifying it to work with alphaBeta pruned Minimax.
## What it ended up being
So in the end the work did paid off, not because I sold it, but because I was happy with what i did.
Sorry that the game is in Macedonian, but in that time in my point of view that was the better choice.

The project is using a single frame to show every view needed for the game, except for the exit button.
The chess game can be started in PvP mode or versus AI (which is called Aida, the first two letters resembling the AI)

The program itself is generating the available and prohibits taking an illegal move.
